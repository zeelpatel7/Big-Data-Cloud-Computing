### 1. Amazon Reviews with SparkDF and Big Data on GCP Dataproc
This notebook focuses on analyzing Amazon product reviews using Spark DataFrames and GCP Dataproc. The analysis includes data cleaning (removing null values and cleaning product categories), identifying the product category with the most reviews, analyzing star ratings, and examining seasonality trends across different decades. It also explores the consistency of reviews by category and identifies patterns related to the timing of reviews, providing insights into consumer behavior and product review dynamics over time.

### 2. Data Engineering with Spark Dataframes
This notebook demonstrates various data engineering techniques using Spark DataFrames. The primary tasks involve data preprocessing, data transformation, and feature extraction. The notebook also showcases exploratory data analysis, including insights into delays and the distribution of flights across different times of the day. Analyses include worst delays by time, weekend effects, and a comparison of flight activity between 2007 and 2008. Visualizations help understand patterns in flight delays and operational behavior over time.

### 3. Data Exploration and Preparation Using Spark RDD
This notebook covers data exploration and preparation using Spark RDDs. The steps include copying and unzipping a dataset, reading data into Spark RDD, and processing the header record. The analysis involves calculating the frequency of offenses by offense case type and identifying the most frequent offenses by charge description. The notebook demonstrates foundational techniques for processing large datasets and generating meaningful frequency-based insights.
